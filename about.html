      <h1>About Ashes to Altar</h1>
      <p>
        Ashes to Altar was born out of a simple desire: to take Scripture seriously,  
        to wrestle honestly with hard questions, and to look for the patterns of mercy
        and restoration that run through the whole story of the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not an academic journal, and it is not a replacement for community or discipleship.
        It is a quiet corner for study, reflection, and creative work rooted in the God of Israel
        and in the hope that He still restores what is broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll find essays, threads, and media that explore the Hebrew Scriptures, the words of Yeshua,
        and the long arc of covenant—from exile to return, from ashes to altar. Some pieces lean more
        “study,” others more “story,” and a few wander into music and art.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any of this stirs you to open a Bible, to pray, to repent, or simply to think more deeply
        about who God is and what He has said, then this little project has done its job.
