        Foundations – Lesson 6
      </p>

      <div class="meta">Foundations · Lesson 6</div>
      <h1>Discipleship as Covenant Faithfulness</h1>

      <p>
        The Foundations series has traced the covenant story of Scripture: creation, calling,
        Torah, prophets, exile, Messiah, and the New Covenant. The final question is simple and
        demanding: <strong>What does this mean for how we actually live?</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Not just belief, but allegiance</h2>
      <p>
        In Scripture, faith is not mere agreement with ideas. It is trust and allegiance to a
        Person. To confess Yeshua as Lord is to give Him our loyalty above every other claim: nation,
        family, self, and culture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Discipleship, then, is covenant faithfulness to Yeshua – aligning our lives with His
        teaching, His example, and His commands, empowered by His Spirit.
      </p>

      <h2>Community shaped by the story</h2>
      <p>
        Because the Bible’s story is covenantal and communal, discipleship cannot be reduced to a
        private spiritual journey. We are called into a people. Together we:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gather to remember God’s acts and promises.</li>
        <li>Hear and obey the Scriptures.</li>
        <li>Confess sin and extend forgiveness.</li>
        <li>Practice hospitality, justice, and mercy.</li>
        <li>Wait in hope for the full restoration God has promised.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The world learns who our King is not only by our words, but by the kind of community we
        become under His rule.
      </p>

      <h2>Living between exile and restoration</h2>
      <p>
        We live in the tension between what has already been accomplished in Messiah and what is
        not yet complete. Sin and death have been decisively confronted, yet we still see
        brokenness, injustice, and idolatry. Scripture names this tension and teaches us how to
        live in it: with hope, endurance, and faithfulness.
      </p>

      <p>
        We resist the pull to despair (“nothing will change”) and the pull to triumphalism
        (“everything is already fine”). Instead, we bear witness: living as citizens of the coming
        kingdom in the midst of the present age.
      </p>

      <h2>Practices that keep us rooted</h2>
      <p>
        Covenant faithfulness is nourished by concrete practices. Different communities will walk
        these out in different ways, but the core is shared:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Regular immersion in Scripture, read as a unified story.</li>
        <li>Prayer that seeks God’s will and aligns our desires with His.</li>
        <li>Obedience in areas where His commands are clear, even when costly.</li>
        <li>Gathering with others who are committed to the same King.</li>
        <li>Remembering Yeshua’s death and resurrection as the center of our hope.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>From foundations to faithfulness</h2>
      <p>
        These lessons have not been about mastering information but about resetting the way we see
        God, Scripture, and ourselves. The goal is that we would live differently: as a people who
        know the story we belong to, trust the King who leads it, and walk in covenant faithfulness
        as we wait for the day when exile is finally over and God dwells with His people face to
        face.
      </p>

      <p>
        From here, other studies and series will build on these foundations, exploring specific
        books, themes, and practices in greater depth. But the core remains: this is His story, and
        we are invited to live inside it.
