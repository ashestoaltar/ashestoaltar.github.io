  <h2 class="teaching-title">Foundations – Lesson 1<br><span>What the Bible Actually Is</span></h2>

  <p class="teaching-intro">
    Most of us meet the Bible long after we’ve inherited assumptions about what it is. 
    But Scripture introduces itself not as a random anthology or devotional collection, 
    but as a unified covenant story—creation, calling, covenant, rebellion, exile, and 
    restoration—woven into the history of God and His people. 
    This lesson lays the foundation for reading the Bible on its own terms.

    <h3>1. The Bible as a Covenant Document</h3>
    <p>
      The Hebrew <strong>berit</strong> and Greek <strong>diathēkē</strong> remind us that a covenant 
      is relational, binding, and purposeful. 
      Scripture presents itself as the unfolding record of God’s covenant with His people.

    <h3>2. Covenant as the Bible’s Structural Spine</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Creation is covenantal.</li>
      <li>Promises to Noah and Abraham are covenantal.</li>
      <li>Torah reveals covenant terms.</li>
      <li>Prophets call Israel back to the covenant.</li>
      <li>Exile is covenant consequence.</li>
      <li>Messiah renews and fulfills the covenant.</li>
      <li>The Apostolic Writings teach covenant communities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Covenant is the skeleton beneath every narrative, law, poem, and prophecy.

    <h3>3. The Bible’s Recurring Pattern</h3>
    <p>
      Scripture follows a consistent narrative arc:
    </p>
    <div class="pattern">
      <strong>Creation → Calling → Covenant → Rebellion → Exile → Restoration</strong>
    </div>
    <p>
      This pattern appears in the lives of Adam, Israel, the prophets, the remnant, 
      and is ultimately fulfilled in Messiah.

    <h3>4. The Bible’s Genres Serve the Covenant Story</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Narrative</strong> records the covenant unfolding.</li>
      <li><strong>Torah</strong> defines covenant life.</li>
      <li><strong>Psalms</strong> express covenant worship.</li>
      <li><strong>Wisdom</strong> shapes covenant character.</li>
      <li><strong>Prophets</strong> enforce covenant terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Gospels</strong> reveal Messiah as fulfillment.</li>
      <li><strong>Epistles</strong> instruct covenant communities among the nations.</li>
      <li><strong>Revelation</strong> reveals covenant restoration in the new creation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Beyond “Old” and “New” Testament</h3>
    <p>
      Yeshua said, “Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. 
      I did not come to destroy but to fulfill” (Matthew 5:17 NKJV). 
      Fulfillment is completion, not cancellation. 
      The Apostolic Writings are the continuation and climax of the same covenant story, 
      not a replacement of it.

    <h3>6. How Covenant Shapes Our Reading</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We see the unity of the story.</li>
      <li>We recognize covenant blessings and warnings.</li>
      <li>We see Israel’s central role in God’s purposes.</li>
      <li>We understand Messiah as the covenant’s fulfillment.</li>
      <li>We read Scripture communally, as a people.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="teaching-section">
    <h3>7. What This Means for Us as Disciples</h3>
    <p>
      Recognizing Scripture as covenant changes our posture. 
      We do not read as isolated individuals but as a community shaped together by the same Word. 
      We ask not, “What verse fixes my problem?” but “Where are we in the covenant story, and what 
      does faithfulness look like for us?”
    </p>

  <section class="teaching-section">
    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What assumptions have we carried into our reading of Scripture?</li>
      <li>Where do we see covenant patterns repeating across the Bible?</li>
      <li>How does this understanding deepen our walk as disciples?</li>
      <li>What does faithfulness look like for us in this part of the story?</li>
    </ul>
