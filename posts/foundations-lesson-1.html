      <h1>What the Bible Actually Is</h1>

      <p>
        Most of us meet the Bible long after we have already inherited assumptions about what it is.
        Some of us were taught it is a devotional manual, a rulebook, a collection of inspirational
        verses, or a theological encyclopedia. But if we want to walk faithfully as disciples, we
        have to let Scripture speak for itself. This first lesson in the Foundations series asks a
        basic but crucial question:
        <strong>What is the Bible, according to its own story?</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Taken on its own terms, the Bible is not a random grab-bag of religious texts. It is the
        covenant record of a King, His people, and His kingdom project: the story of how the God of
        Israel creates, calls, judges, restores, and ultimately dwells with a people who bear His
        name.
      </p>

      <h2>The Bible as a covenant document</h2>
      <p>
        In Hebrew the word for covenant is <em>berit</em>; in Greek it is <em>diathēkē</em>. Both
        speak of a binding relationship with obligations, blessings, and consequences. A covenant is
        not just a “spiritual feeling” but a concrete, relational commitment. In the ancient world it
        could describe treaties between kings or solemn agreements sealed with sacrifice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Scripture presents itself as the unfolding record of God’s covenant with His people. From
        Noah and Abraham to Sinai, David, the prophets, and the New Covenant in Messiah, the Bible
        shows God binding Himself to a people, calling them to loyalty, warning them of judgment,
        and promising restoration.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The Bible is not mainly a book about “how to get to heaven.” It is the testimony of how the
        God of heaven brings His reign to earth through a covenant people.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Covenant as the spine of the story</h2>
      <p>
        Once we see covenant, the shape of the Bible comes into focus. A pattern emerges again and
        again:
      </p>

      <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; margin: 10px 0;">
        Creation → Calling → Covenant → Rebellion → Exile → Restoration
      </p>

      <p>
        We see it in Eden and the fall. We see it in Abraham’s family, in the Exodus and Sinai, in
        the rise and fall of Israel’s kings, in the Babylonian exile and the return. The prophets
        constantly call the people back to the covenant they have broken, warning of judgment and
        promising restoration.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, this pattern reaches its climax in Yeshua the Messiah. He embodies Israel,
        fulfills the promises, bears the covenant curses, and inaugurates the promised restoration.
        Through Him, the blessings of the covenant spread out to the nations, and we are grafted
        into Israel’s story.
      </p>

      <h2>The Bible’s genres serve the covenant story</h2>
      <p>
        The Bible is made up of many kinds of writing—narrative, law, poetry, wisdom, prophecy,
        gospels, and letters—but they are not disconnected pieces. Each genre serves the one
        covenant story:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Narrative</strong> recounts how the covenant unfolds in real history.</li>
        <li><strong>Torah</strong> gives the terms of covenant life—how a redeemed people live as God’s own.</li>
        <li><strong>Psalms</strong> are covenant prayers and songs, from trust to lament to praise.</li>
        <li><strong>Wisdom</strong> shows covenant faithfulness in daily decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Prophets</strong> prosecute the covenant, confronting idolatry and injustice.</li>
        <li><strong>Gospels</strong> reveal Yeshua
