      <h1>How the Bible Tells Its Story</h1>

      <p>
        In Lesson 1 we saw that the Bible is not a random anthology but the covenant story of God
        and His people. In this lesson we look at <strong>how</strong> that story is told. The Bible
        does not simply drop isolated doctrines from heaven. It weaves meaning through narrative,
        poetry, patterns, and what we often call “typology” – earlier events, people, and symbols
        that foreshadow greater realities still to come.
      </p>

      <h2>Story before system</h2>
      <p>
        Modern readers are often trained to think in systems and bullet points. Scripture, by
        contrast, is overwhelmingly narrative. Genesis, Exodus, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, the
        Gospels and Acts all move the story forward. Even the letters and psalms assume we know the
        story they are commenting on.
      </p>

      <p>
        This means we do not truly understand a verse until we know the story it belongs to. The
        covenant is not given as an abstract list of ideas but as God’s actions in history:
        creating, calling, rescuing, judging, restoring.
      </p>

      <h2>Patterns and repetition</h2>
      <p>
        One of the key ways Scripture teaches is by repeating patterns. We meet familiar shapes in
        different generations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A garden or land given, then lost.</li>
        <li>A younger son chosen over an older.</li>
        <li>A righteous sufferer vindicated by God.</li>
        <li>Exile followed by a return and rebuilding.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These repetitions are not accidents. They train us to see <strong>how</strong> God works,
        and to recognize when He is doing something similar again in a deeper way. When Yeshua
        feeds in the wilderness, passes through water, or speaks on a mountain, those are not
        random details—they echo earlier moments in Israel’s story.
      </p>

      <h2>Typology: shadows and substances</h2>
      <p>
        The New Testament often speaks of earlier parts of Scripture as “shadows” or “types”
        pointing toward Messiah. Paul can say that the events in the wilderness “happened to them
        as examples” and “were written for our admonition” (1 Corinthians 10:11). The writer of
        Hebrews speaks of the tabernacle as “a copy and shadow of the heavenly things”
        (Hebrews 8:5).
      </p>

      <p>
        A type is not a prediction in the narrow sense. It is a pattern, a shape in history that
        finds its fullest meaning in Messiah. Adam, Israel, David, the temple, the sacrifices –
        all of these are real in their own right, and at the same time they point beyond
        themselves.
      </p>

      <h2>Reading with the grain of Scripture</h2>
      <p>
        When we pay attention to narrative, patterns, and typology, we begin to read with the
        grain of Scripture instead of against it. Rather than forcing the Bible into our own
        systems, we let its own storytelling shape our understanding. We ask questions like:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>How does this story echo earlier stories?</li>
        <li>What covenant promises or warnings are being picked up here?</li>
        <li>How might this event be a “shadow” of something greater fulfilled in Messiah?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This does not mean we can make patterns say whatever we want. Patterns are grounded in the
        text itself, and they are confirmed by how later biblical authors use earlier passages.
        Our task is to pay attention, to listen, and to be willing to see the connections Scripture
        itself makes.
      </p>

      <h2>Why this matters for discipleship</h2>
      <p>
        As disciples, we are not memorizing random facts; we are being formed by a story. Seeing
        how the Bible tells that story helps us locate ourselves within it. We recognize the
        patterns of exile and restoration, the pull of idolatry, the call of faithfulness, and the
        way Messiah walks the path Israel could not walk on its own.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we open the Scriptures, we are stepping into a living narrative that still shapes us
        today. The same God is still at work, and the same story is still unfolding toward its
        promised restoration.
      </p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Where have we seen repeated patterns as we read the Bible?</li>
        <li>How does thinking in story form change the way we read individual verses?</li>
        <li>What does it mean for us to live as characters in God’s ongoing covenant story?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In the next lesson we will turn to the Torah—often misunderstood as “mere law”—and see it
        instead as covenant instruction for a redeemed people.
