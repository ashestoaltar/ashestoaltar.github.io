      <h1>Prophets, Exile, and the Hope of Restoration</h1>

      <p>
        If Torah sets out the covenant terms, the prophets show us what happens when those terms
        are broken—and what God intends to do about it. Their words can feel harsh, poetic,
        confusing, and beautiful all at once. At the heart of their message is a simple pattern:
        covenant unfaithfulness leads to judgment and exile, yet God’s commitment to His covenant
        drives Him to promise restoration.
      </p>

      <h2>Prophets as covenant prosecutors</h2>
      <p>
        Prophets are not primarily fortune-tellers. They are covenant messengers. They stand in
        God’s council, see His perspective on Israel’s life, and speak His evaluation into real
        political, social, and spiritual situations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again and again they bring charges:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Idolatry and divided allegiance.</li>
        <li>Injustice toward the poor, widows, and strangers.</li>
        <li>Empty worship divorced from obedience.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Their warnings are not arbitrary. They are grounded in the blessings and curses of the
        covenant, especially as laid out in Leviticus 26 and Deuteronomy 28–30.
      </p>

      <h2>Exile as covenant consequence</h2>
      <p>
        When Israel persists in rebellion, exile follows. The northern kingdom goes to Assyria.
        The southern kingdom goes to Babylon. Land, temple, and kingship are all shaken. In human
        terms, it looks like the end of the story.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the prophets also insist that exile is not the final word. It is discipline with a
        redemptive purpose. God uses it to purge idolatry, expose false security, and bring His
        people to repentance.
      </p>

      <h2>Promises of restoration</h2>
      <p>
        Alongside warnings, the prophets speak stunning promises of restoration:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A new heart and a new spirit (Ezekiel 36).</li>
        <li>A renewed covenant written on the heart (Jeremiah 31).</li>
        <li>Return from exile and renewed fruitfulness in the land.</li>
        <li>The coming of a righteous king from David’s line.</li>
        <li>Light for the nations and justice for the oppressed.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These promises are not vague optimism. They are rooted in God’s faithfulness to His
        covenant with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and David.
      </p>

      <h2>Exile as an ongoing reality</h2>
      <p>
        Even after some Jews returned from Babylon and rebuilt the Temple, many in the Second
        Temple period believed that, in a deeper sense, exile was not yet over. Foreign powers
        still ruled the land. The prophetic promises felt only partially fulfilled.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the world into which Yeshua steps—a world still longing for true restoration.
      </p>

      <h2>Why this matters for us</h2>
      <p>
        As disciples, we read the prophets not as distant poetry but as God’s assessment of covenant
        life. We see how easily worship can become empty, how quickly injustice can spread when
        God’s ways are ignored, and how stubborn the human heart can be.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, we cling to the same hope: that the God who judges is also the God who
        restores. Exile is real, but it is not the end. The prophetic promises push us to look
        toward Messiah and the renewal He brings—and to examine where we, too, may be living as
        exiles needing to return.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next lesson we will turn directly to Messiah and the New Covenant, and see how He
        fulfills the story the prophets told.
