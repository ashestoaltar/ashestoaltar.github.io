      <h1>Torah as Covenant Instruction</h1>

      <p>
        Few words are more misunderstood in modern Christianity than <em>Torah</em>. For some it
        means “legalism.” For others it is the “old way” that Messiah came to remove. But within
        Scripture itself, Torah is a gift—a gracious revelation of how a redeemed people are to
        live as God’s own.
      </p>

      <h2>Torah means instruction</h2>
      <p>
        The Hebrew word <em>Torah</em> is often translated “law,” but its basic sense is
        instruction, teaching, guidance. The God who rescued Israel from Egypt did not leave His
        people to guess how to live. He spoke. He gave concrete ways of life that reflected His
        character—justice, mercy, holiness, care for the vulnerable, and distinct worship.
      </p>

      <p>
        Importantly, Torah is given <strong>after</strong> redemption. Israel is not told to keep
        Torah in order to earn rescue. They are rescued by grace, then instructed how to live in
        covenant faithfulness.
      </p>

      <h2>Delight, not mere duty</h2>
      <p>
        The Psalms do not speak of Torah as a crushing weight. They speak of it as delight:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Oh, how I love Your law! It is my meditation all the day.” (Psalm 119:97)
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Torah shows Israel what God loves and what He hates. It trains the heart. It shapes a
        people who embody God’s character in the world. When Israel treats Torah as a checklist,
        they miss the point. When they ignore it, they break covenant. The faithful response is
        love-driven obedience.
      </p>

      <h2>Common misunderstandings</h2>
      <p>
        Many of us have been taught things about Torah that do not match the biblical picture:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>“Torah was Plan A, Messiah is Plan B.”</strong><br />
          In reality, Messiah is the goal Torah points toward. The story was always heading there.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>“Torah is about works, the New Testament is about grace.”</strong><br />
          Scripture consistently shows grace before obedience. The Exodus comes before Sinai.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>“Torah was impossible to keep.”</strong><br />
          While no one keeps it perfectly, the text often speaks of people walking blamelessly or
          turning back in repentance. Torah anticipates both faithfulness and mercy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Messiah and Torah</h2>
      <p>
        Yeshua does not dismiss Torah. He intensifies and internalizes it. He exposes the heart
        beneath the commandments and calls His disciples to a righteousness that goes deeper than
        mere external compliance.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Him, the prophetic promise is fulfilled that God would write His Torah on the hearts of
        His people (Jeremiah 31:33). The question is no longer whether Torah matters, but how it
        is to be lived in light of His life, death, resurrection, and kingship.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Torah still matters for us</h2>
      <p>
        As disciples, we do not return to Torah as if Messiah never came. But neither do we treat
        Torah as irrelevant. It reveals the character of the God we claim to follow. It helps us
        discern what faithfulness looks like in a world that constantly pulls us toward other
        allegiances.
      </p>

      <p>
        We learn to ask:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What does this command reveal about God’s heart?</li>
        <li>How is this fulfilled, deepened, or clarified in Messiah?</li>
        <li>What does it mean for us to walk in the same pattern of holiness and justice today?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In the next lesson we will turn to the prophets, exile, and the hope of restoration—and
        see how they confront covenant unfaithfulness while holding out a future hope rooted in
        God’s promises.
