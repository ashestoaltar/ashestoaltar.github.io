      <h1>Messiah and the New Covenant</h1>

      <p>
        The entire covenant story of Scripture leads us to Yeshua the Messiah. He is not an
        interruption in Israel’s story but its fulfillment. The promises of a renewed covenant, a
        cleansed heart, a Spirit-filled people, and a restored kingdom all converge in Him.
      </p>

      <h2>“I did not come to destroy but to fulfill”</h2>
      <p>
        Yeshua’s own words set the tone:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but
        to fulfill.” (Matthew 5:17 NKJV)
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Fulfillment means bringing the story to its intended goal. Yeshua embodies Israel’s calling
        in perfect obedience, bears the covenant curses in His death, and brings the covenant
        blessings to resurrection life.
      </p>

      <h2>The promised New Covenant</h2>
      <p>
        The prophets looked forward to a renewed covenant:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts… For I will forgive their
        iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.” (Jeremiah 31:33–34)
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Yeshua identifies His death with this promise:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you.” (Luke 22:20)
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The New Covenant does not erase everything that came before. It internalizes and
        intensifies it. The same God, the same Torah written on the heart, the same covenant
        faithfulness—now empowered by the Spirit and centered explicitly on Messiah’s finished
        work.
      </p>

      <h2>Messiah for Israel and the nations</h2>
      <p>
        Yeshua comes “to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,” yet the covenant promises always
        had the nations in view. Through Him, Gentiles are grafted into the cultivated olive tree
        of Israel (Romans 11). They are not starting a new story; they are being joined to an
        existing one.
      </p>

      <p>
        This guards us from two opposite errors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Replacing Israel and imagining the Church as a separate people with a separate story.</li>
        <li>Ignoring the unity of Jew and Gentile in Messiah as one new humanity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Life in the New Covenant</h2>
      <p>
        The New Covenant is not simply a new set of ideas. It is a new way of life under a risen
        King. The Spirit is poured out. Hearts are circumcised. Communities are formed where
        forgiveness, generosity, holiness, and mutual submission are central.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Apostolic writings show us what this looks like in real congregations—Jew and Gentile
        learning to walk together in the way of Messiah, grounded in the Scriptures of Israel and
        animated by the Spirit.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the final lesson of this series, we will look at discipleship as covenant faithfulness
        today—how this whole story shapes our actual lives, practices, and hope.
