      <h1>A Faithful Reading of the Binding of Isaac</h1>

      <p>
        Few stories in Scripture provoke more debate than the Binding of Isaac — the moment when 
        God commands Abraham to take his son up the mountain. Some modern interpretations attempt 
        to soften the force of the narrative, suggesting that God never truly required a sacrifice 
        and that Abraham misunderstood the command from the start.
      </p>

      <p>
        But does the text support that reading? And what do we lose when we sand down the tension 
        Scripture intentionally gives us?
      </p>

      <h2>The weight of the command</h2>

      <p>
        In Hebrew, the key phrase is <em>le‘olah</em> — often translated “as a burnt offering.” 
        The root word <em>olah</em> consistently refers throughout the Torah to a sacrifice wholly 
        consumed by fire. It is not used for symbolic “uplift,” emotional struggle, or spiritual 
        metaphor. It is used for something placed on the altar.
      </p>

      <p>
        To claim that Abraham merely misunderstood softens a passage that is meant to force a 
        crisis: between the promise, the God who gave it, and the son through whom it would be 
        fulfilled.
      </p>

      <h2>Abraham’s response</h2>

      <p>
        Abraham rises early. He prepares wood. He travels. The narrative slows down, emphasizing 
        every movement. The text gives no hint of confusion — only obedience and trust, combined 
        with deep anguish.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The story forces us to confront a difficult truth: faith is not always clarity. 
        Sometimes it is obedience in the dark.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>“God will provide”</h2>

      <p>
        Abraham’s words to Isaac — “God will provide for Himself the lamb” — are often read as a 
        prophetic hint. But they are also a statement of trust in the face of impossibility. The 
        author of Hebrews even interprets Abraham’s actions as faith that God could raise the dead.
      </p>

      <p>
        The turning point comes on the altar: the angel calls out, stays his hand, and a ram is 
        provided “instead of” Isaac. The mountain becomes a place where death is both demanded 
        and averted — where judgment and mercy intersect.
      </p>

      <h2>Why this debate matters today</h2>

      <p>
        The popular claim — often repeated online and in some YouTube explanations — is that this 
        story is not about sacrifice at all, but about God correcting Abraham. This interpretation 
        tends to arise from discomfort with the severity of the text. Yet it removes the very 
        tension the story is designed to confront.
      </p>

      <p>
        If “olah” doesn’t mean what it means everywhere else…  
        If Abraham is confused rather than faithful…  
        If God’s test is actually a misunderstanding…  
        Then the narrative collapses into something far smaller than what Genesis gives us.
      </p>

      <h2>A connection to later Scripture</h2>

      <p>
        Christian readers have long seen in this narrative a foreshadowing: a beloved son, wood 
        laid upon him, a journey to a mountain, and a substitute provided. Whether one draws that 
        connection or not, the literary and theological weight is unmistakable.
      </p>

      <h2>A faithful reading</h2>

      <p>
        A faithful reading does two things:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          It <strong>does not soften</strong> the cost Abraham is ask
