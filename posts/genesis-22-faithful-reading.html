      <h1>A Faithful Reading of the Binding of Isaac</h1>

      <p>
        Few passages in Scripture generate as much unease and debate as the Binding of Isaac.
        Abraham is asked to offer up the son of promise, and readers have wrestled for centuries
        with what that means about God, faith, and obedience.
      </p>

      <p>
        In recent years, some have tried to resolve that tension by suggesting that Abraham
        simply misunderstood the command – that God never truly required a sacrifice, and that
        the story is more about correcting Abraham than testing him. But does the text itself
        actually support that reading?
      </p>

      <h2>The weight of the command</h2>
      <p>
        In Hebrew, the key phrase is often translated “as a burnt offering.” The term carries
        the idea of something wholly given over – ascending in smoke, completely surrendered.
        It is not a casual metaphor for “a difficult experience” or “spiritual growth.” The
        narrative asks us to look squarely at the cost.
      </p>

      <p>
        A faithful reading doesn’t downplay that cost, but it also doesn’t stop there. The
        same passage reveals a God who both tests and provides, who refuses human sacrifice
        even as He uses the language of sacrifice to expose what lives in Abraham’s heart.
      </p>

      <h2>Provision on the mountain</h2>
      <p>
        At the climax of the story, the angel of the Lord intervenes, and a ram is provided
        “instead of” Isaac. The mountain becomes the place where judgment and mercy meet –
        where something truly dies, but the promised son lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        For many readers, this points forward to another Son and another hill, where the
        pattern of offering and provision is fulfilled in a way Genesis 22 only sketches in
        outline. The text invites us to see both the severity and the kindness of God.
      </p>

      <h2>Why this still matters</h2>
      <p>
        How we read Genesis 22 will shape how we talk about trust, obedience, and the
        character of the God we claim to worship. We don’t honor the passage – or the people
        who have wrestled with it – by sanding off its rough edges. We honor it by letting it
        say what it says, and then asking what kind of God both tests and provides like this.
